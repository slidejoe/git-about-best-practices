title: Why am I being such a git about best practices?
info: |
  Are your git repos a dumping ground for code? I'm really fussy about how people use git - and that's a good thing. We'll take a look at branching strategies, the importance of commit messages and how often should you commit, anyway? Let's investigate how, with 5 simple tips, we can turn a code dump into a glorious archive of software and how this can save time, frustration and money.

## What is **git**?
<!--
Let's start really simple: what is git? Git is the most popular Source Control Management (SCM) system.

- <solar-archive-up-bold-duotone /> Versioning

It can ensure your code is backed up, versioned and accessible to other developers.

- <solar-rocket-2-bold-duotone /> Release management
- <solar-star-fall-bold-duotone />Feature development
- <solar-recive-twice-square-bold-duotone /> Concurrent working

<!--
But used properly it can be so much more helping ease complex processes such as release management, feature development and multiple people working concurrently. But I can be a bit of a git about it: I'm really fussy about how people use git - and that's a good thing. I've worked with a fair few organisations and development teams over the years, and poor git utilisation is a more common issue than you might think.

## Imagine being in Dennis' situation and...

- you've discovered a bug introduced in the latest version?
  Where do you even start to look for the solution?
- You see something odd in the codebase, there's no comment so you use a blame/annotate tool to see who changed it and why... but Andy is on holiday and his commit message says ‚Äútest‚Äù
- Some piece of code has changed since you last saw it - why?
  You could revert it back to how you like it but maybe it was changed for a reason?
  You fire up the blame tool again, ‚ÄúFixes date formatting issue in Chrome‚Äù - better leave it as it is!
  Saved by a good commit message!

## Reverting little things

You can also use your tiny commits to help you revert unwanted pieces of functionality, while it can be a real pain to pull small chunks of code out of a bigger commit.

Perhaps changing the colour-scheme to green text on a red background was a <i>bit</i> much...?

<!-- If you want to combine multiple commits, or you've already committed your second round of changes, you can look into "squashing" the commits. In GitKraken, this is done by selecting the multiple commits you want to combine, right clicking and selecting "Squash". There are some scenarios when squashing won't be available - in this case you might be best just leaving the history as-is! So what does squash do, exactly? Squash is a method of "rewriting history" in git. Essentially, it pretends your initial commits never happened, and creates a new commit containing all the changes from your previous commits. -->

```

<!-- The reason we have to `push --force` is because we've changed the commits we've already pushed, rewriting history. On the left is how our remote thinks our branch looks, but on the right is how we think the branch looks on our local machine (after squashing). Since the commits are different, git want's us to be sure we want to overwrite what's on the server with what we have locally, hence "forcing" that overwrite. The only real thing to be wary of here is if anybody else has been working on the same branch, you might overwrite their work too. So it's best to avoid this (but also always check for new commits before you force push!) -->

Before I go to bed, I might do a quick tidy up but the next day, once I've finished the piece of work, all the tools go away and I vacuum up the mess I made. I'll definitely have it clean and tidy before I let anybody else in the house! Treat your branches the same way. It's OK for them to be a bit messy while you've got things in progress, but as soon as you're finished or ready to merge into a shared branch, you ought to tidy it up - nobody wants to see your messy branch! -->

<!-- TODO: longer version should have CommonFlow too -->

<!--
GitHub flow, put very simply, involves creating a branch for your feature (with a short descriptive name), Adding your commits to that branch, each commit containing "an isolated, complete change" and then opening a Pull Request. You discuss and review your code changes with your colleagues. Once everyone is happy, your Pull Request is merged into the main branch. Main is always in a deployable state. The GitHub flow tutorial goes into a little more detail.

It's worth noting that if none of these git flows make sense to you, you can take inspiration from them. I don't know of many companies who strictly follow any one particular strategy. So pick one as a baseline and adapt it for your organisation. GitHub Flow and GitLab Flow don't have to be restricted to GitHub or GitLab - you can use any flow anywhere

<!-- Which leaves us with "Rebase and merge". This option allows us to avoid losing data while keeping the tree clean and tidy so is, of course, my favourite. (If you're using Azure DevOps, you can set this method as the merge type too - they call it a ["semi-linear merge"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/pull-requests-with-rebase/#semi-linear-merge)).  -->
